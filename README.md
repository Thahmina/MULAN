# MULAN: 
Guide to integrating Multi-Layered Drug-Gene-Pathway-Disease Network (MULAN) database, documentation manual provided in this repository. 
 
`MULAN serves as a prototype that uses mysql database language and data obtained from genomic databases to make associations between biological interactions. The interactions includes protein-chemical interactions, gene-disease, drug-disease, drug-phenotype, gene-phenotype to draw dementia-associated biological pathways called networks and link FDA-approved drugs with current disease phenotypes and side effects. By creating biological networks and finding associations between biological interactions will help discover novel drug targets that are related to a disease pathway in comparison to existing ones.
